/* STMicroelectronics lsm6ds3 sensor */

Required properties:
	- compatible : should be "st,lsm6ds3"
	- reg : the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:
	- interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
	- interrupts : interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ, it should by configured with
		flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH

Example:

lsm6ds3@6b {
	compatible = "st,lsm6ds3";
	reg = <0x6b>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
