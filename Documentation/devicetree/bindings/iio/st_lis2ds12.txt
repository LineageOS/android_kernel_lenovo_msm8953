/* STMicroelectronics lis2ds12 sensor */

Required properties:
	- compatible : should be "st,lis2ds12"
	- reg : the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:
	- interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
	- interrupts : interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ, it should by configured with
		flags IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING

Example:

lis2ds12@1d {
	compatible = "st,lis2ds12";
	reg = <0x1d>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
